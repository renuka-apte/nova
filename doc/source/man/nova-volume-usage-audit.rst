DESCRIPTION

Cron script to generate usage notifications for volumes existing during
the audit period.

Together with the notifications generated by volumes
create/delete/resize, over that time period, this allows an external
system consuming usage notification feeds to calculate volume usage
for each tenant.

Time periods are specified as 'hour', 'month', 'day' or 'year'

hour = previous hour. If run at 9:07am, will generate usage for 8-9am.
month = previous month. If the script is run April 1, it will generate
        usages for March 1 through March 31.
day = previous day. if run on July 4th, it generates usages for July 3rd.
year = previous year. If run on Jan 1, it generates usages for
     Jan 1 through Dec 31 of the previous year.
